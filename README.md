# Learning Hamiltonians of constrained mechanical systems

This repository collects the Notebooks written for the numerical experiments of the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13254

The repository has two sub-folders, one for the experiments for constrained systems and one for the unconstrained ones.
